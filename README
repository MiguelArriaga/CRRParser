This script is to help get CRR data from the EBA website

TODOS:
 - Handle better the nested nature of the CRR articles, e.g. Article 19

 - Place an [img] tag where images are supposed to be inserted
 - Create an image inventory to save images from the CRR website (e.g. formulas), using a unique identifier for the
   image and then make the [img] tags refer to these images.

 - Place an [tbl] tag where tables are supposed to be inserted
 - Create an table inventory to save tables from the CRR website as csv files, using a unique identifier for the table
   and then make the [tbl] tags refer to these tables.
